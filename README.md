# FrequencyPro2

This little program lets you know the frequency in Hz for any note. 
Upon running the program from the command prompt, the program asks the user to enter any note. After the note ("A" - "G#) is entered and returned, the program then asks "Which Octave?", to which the user enters any value from 0-9 (the higher the value, the higher the octave and corresponding frequency in Hz.). After the octave value is entered, the program, gives the frequency of the note.
